# Godot Simple Networking

This networking system in Godot allows seamless connections to an online server, player spawning, and position updates. To prevent cheating like teleporting or altering the movement speed, the system employs a client-side input-based movement approach, where the movement inputs are transmitted instead of the calculated results.

Project is based on https://github.com/Linko-3D/Godot-Simple-Networking



## How to play

- Use arrow keys for movement
- Use <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key to “cheat” -> you will notice this works only on the server, not on the client
